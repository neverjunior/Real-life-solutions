# Text-user-interface
So this is the menu tool which will let you do almost all linux tasks very easily without even knowning the commands.
steps to use just clone the repo and open it with python3.


# Calculator 
this cal is different from others cause as we can see some coders make a calculator but which is not at all useful no tough evaluation can be done and also the functionality to use more than one operators is also not possible
Here this calculator can do all task as same as our android's calculator.



# Tree 
So in linux there is no inbuilt function for directory listing their are some python functions made for this like os.walk() from os module but i made this without using any already build function i just made it using system commmand , loop and recursion.
